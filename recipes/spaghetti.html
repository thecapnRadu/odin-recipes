        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>400 grams</strong> Minced Beef</li>
            <li><strong>800 grams</strong> Tin Chopped Tomatoes</li>
            <li><strong>400 grams</strong> Spaghetti</li>
            <li><strong>100 grams</strong> Carrots, <em>grated</em></li>
            <li><strong>2</strong> Garlic Cloves, <em>chopped</em></li>
            <li><strong>1</strong> Onion, <em>diced</em></li>
            <li><strong>2 tbsp</strong> Olive Oil</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Pepper</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat a large saucepan over a medium heat. Add a tablespoon of olive oil and once hot add the minced beef and 
                a pinch of salt and pepper. Cook the meat until well browned over a medium-high heat (be careful not to burn 
                the mince. It just needs to be a dark brown colour). Once browned, transfer the mince to a bowl and set aside.</li>
            <li>Add another tablespoon of oil to the saucepan you browned the meat in and turn the heat to medium. Add the 
                onions and a pinch of salt and fry gently for 5-6 minutes, or until softened and translucent. Add the garlic 
                and cook for another 2 minutes. Add the grated carrot then pour the beef meat back into the saucepan.</li>
            <li>Add the tomatoes to the pan and stir well to mix. Bring to a simmer and then reduce the 
                temperature to simmer gently for 45 minutes, or until the sauce is thick and rich. Taste and adjust the seasoning 
                as necessary.</li>
            <li>When ready to cook the spaghetti, heat a large saucepan of water and add a pinch of salt. Cook according to the 
                packet instructions. Once the spaghetti is cooked through, drain and add to the pan with the bolognese sauce. 
                Mix well and serve.</li>
        </ol>
