        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Let's be honest, who doesn't love quesadillas? They are juicy, easy and fast to make, and they are perfect for almost
        any occasion, especially for those weekend days spent with the friends!</p>
        <p>Without further ado, I will show you the easiest recipe for a delicious chicken quesadilla.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>100 grams</strong> Cheddar Cheese</li>
            <li><strong>400 grams</strong> Chicken Breast </li>
            <li><strong>1</strong> Tomato</li>
            <li><strong>1/2</strong> Red Onion</li>
            <li><strong>1</strong> Bell Pepper</li>
            <li><strong>4</strong> Tortillas</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Chicken Seasoning</li>
            <li>Sunflower Oil</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat a medium frying pan with oil over medium heat until it's hot</li>
            <li>Wash and cut the breast chicken into small pieces, and add the chicken seasoning</li>
            <li>Cook the chicken for about 5 minutes</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, cut the tomato, red onion, and bell pepper into small pieces, and add salt</li>
            <li>When the chicken is almost cooked, add the tomato, red onion, and bell pepper in the pan and cook for 10 minutes</li>
            <li>Heat a large frying pan over medium heat until hot, about 3 minutes. Place a tortilla in the pan and sprinkle 
                with half of the chicken mixture, and half of the cheddar cheese. Top with a second tortilla 
                and cook until the underside of the bottom tortilla is golden brown in several spots and half of the cheese is 
                melted, about 3 minutes. Using a spatula, carefully flip the quesadilla over and cook until the underside of the 
                second tortilla is crisp and golden brown in several spots and all of the cheese is melted, about 2 to 3 minutes 
                more.</li>
            <li>Slide the quesadilla from the pan onto a cutting board and cut into wedges. Repeat with the remaining ingredients 
                to make a second quesadilla. Serve topped with guacamole, salsa, and sour cream, if desired.</li>
        </ol>
